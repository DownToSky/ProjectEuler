Prime numbers
-------------
A prime number is natural number that is only divisible by 1 and itself. A natural number
greater than 1 that is not prime is called composite. 

There are infinitely many primes:
    consider a finite number of primes p1, p2, ... , pn. The following number must also be 
    prime:
        K = 1+(p1)(p2)...(pn)       since it's dividing K by any of the primes has the
                                    remainder 1
    (So we can show that the number of primes is infinite by showing an injection from the
    set of primes found this way to the prime numbers)

Side notes and related topics:
    Goldbach's conjecture: Every even number more than two can be written as sum of two primes
        *)Is still unproven

Finding Primes:
    How do would you code a function that states the primality of a given number?
        most natural way would be trial division:
        Count how many times the number can be divided by m while m goes from 1 to n. Then,
        decide if the number is the 
            *) Two is the only even number
            *) We can easily show that we don't have to check up until more than sqrt(n)
                (show in n = ab, either a or b are < sqrt(n))
